    <ul>
        <li>
            To make a rectangle click on the <button>Rectangle</button> button and then drag the mouse over the canvas.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            To be able to drag the rectangles drawn on the canvas, click on the <button>Make Rectangle draggable</button> button and
            then proceed to move the cursor over a rectangle.
            Press down and hold the left click button on the mouse while it is over a rectangle and then move the cursor
            around the canvas to drag the rectangle.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            To delete a rectangle on the canvas, simply double click when the mouse is over a rectangle you want to be
            deleted.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <button>Clear</button> button will remove everything that has been drawn on the canvas.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <span style="color:red;">[Important]</span> Activating some feature by pressing a button (or double clicking
            on canvas in case of deleting a specific rectangle) will disable all the previously active feature.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <span style="color:red;">[Important]</span> Double clicking anywhere on the canvas outside any of the
            rectangles also disables all other active features (like
            drawing rectangles and being able to drag rectangles).
            So to be able to use the previously active feature like dragging rectangles , reactivate the feature by
            pressing the <button>Make Rectangle draggable</button> button.
        </li>
